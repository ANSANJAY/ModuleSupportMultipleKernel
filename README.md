# Linux Kernel Module Examples 🐧🔧

This repository contains example Linux kernel modules, providing insights into basic structures and functionalities across different kernel versions. It serves as a learning resource for individuals exploring kernel module programming and the nuances of the Linux kernel. 

## Structure 🗂️
The repository is organized into different folders, each corresponding to a specific Linux version or functionality:
- `0_Linux_Version/`
- `1_Linux_Version/`
- `2_UTS_release/`
- `3_multiple_versions/`

Each folder contains:
- `hello.c`: The C source file for the kernel module.
- `Makefile`: The file to assist in compiling the kernel module.
- `readme.md`: Instructions and information related to the specific example.

## How to Use 🛠️
Navigate to any version-specific folder and follow the instructions in the `readme.md` file to compile and load the kernel module.

### Example:
```bash
$ cd 0_Linux_Version
$ make
$ sudo insmod hello.ko
```
