**Section 1: Explain the technical concept ðŸ“˜**

The Linux kernel provides mechanisms to interact and manage processes, and one such fundamental mechanism is through the `task_struct`. This structure encapsulates all relevant information about a process (or task). There are times, especially when developing kernel modules or device drivers, that you might need to obtain information about the currently executing process.

To simplify this process and prevent kernel developers from having to traverse the entire task list to find the currently executing process, the kernel provides a convenience macro called `current`. The `current` macro returns a pointer to the `task_struct` of the process that's currently executing.

However, how the `current` macro works and where the `task_struct` is located varies between different architectures. Some architectures might store the reference to the `task_struct` in a specific CPU register for quick access, while others might place it at the bottom of the kernel stack for the process.

**Section 2: Technical interview questions about this topic and answers ðŸ¤“**

1. **Question:** What is the `current` macro in the context of the Linux kernel?
   **Answer:** The `current` macro is provided by the Linux kernel to give developers a direct pointer to the `task_struct` of the process that is currently executing.

2. **Question:** Why might an architecture choose to store the `task_struct` in a CPU register?
   **Answer:** Storing the `task_struct` in a CPU register allows for very fast and direct access, which can be crucial for performance-critical operations in the kernel.

3. **Question:** If you're writing a kernel module and want to know the Process ID of the currently executing process, how might you retrieve it?
   **Answer:** You can use the `current` macro to get a pointer to the `task_struct` of the current process and then access its `pid` field. For example: `current->pid`.

**Section 3: Explain the concept in simple words for interview preparation ðŸŒŸ**

Think of the Linux kernel as a theater director who is overseeing a play. Each actor (process) has a script (`task_struct`) that provides all the details about their role. Now, the director, amidst all the chaos, needs to quickly know which actor is currently performing on stage without looking through all the scripts. That's where a special note (the `current` macro) comes in handy. By looking at this note, the director instantly knows which actor is on stage. Depending on the theater (or architecture), this note might be pinned on a board nearby (stored in a register) or placed on the actor's chair (bottom of the kernel stack).

While writing a module if we want to get information about the current process that is running in the kernel, we need to read the "task_struct" of the  corresponding process.

The kernel provides a easy way to do this by providing a macro by the name "current", which always returns a pointer to the "task_struct" of the current executing process.

This macro has to be implemented by each architecture.

Some architectures stores this in a register some stores them in bottom of kernel stack of process
