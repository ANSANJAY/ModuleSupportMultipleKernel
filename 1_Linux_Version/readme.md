### 1. Explain the technical concept 📘
The `KERNEL_VERSION` macro is an integral part of kernel module development, especially when dealing with modules that aim to be compatible with different versions of the Linux kernel. This macro is used to construct a single integer value representing the kernel version from the major, minor, and patch levels of the version number. It's defined as `#define KERNEL_VERSION(a,b,c) (((a) << 16) + ((b) << 8) + (c))`, and it's included through the `<linux/version.h>` header file. This integer value is crucial for performing comparisons with the `LINUX_VERSION_CODE` to ensure compatibility and manage API changes between different kernel versions.

### 2. Curious Questions 🤔
**Q:** How is the `KERNEL_VERSION` macro used to evaluate whether the kernel version of the running system is above a certain level?
**A:** Developers can compare the result of `KERNEL_VERSION(a, b, c)` with the `LINUX_VERSION_CODE` to determine the running kernel’s version. If `LINUX_VERSION_CODE >= KERNEL_VERSION(a, b, c)`, then the running kernel's version is equal to or higher than the specified version `a.b.c`.

**Q:** Can you explain how the shifting and addition in the `KERNEL_VERSION` macro lead to a unique integer representing the kernel version?
**A:** The `KERNEL_VERSION` macro takes three integers representing the major, minor, and patch levels. It shifts the major version `a` 16 bits to the left, the minor version `b` 8 bits to the left, and then adds them together with the patch level `c`. This ensures a unique integer value for each different version, which can be easily compared.

### 3. Explain the concept in simple words 🌟
Think of `KERNEL_VERSION` as a special formula 🧪 that takes three ingredients: the major, minor, and patch levels of a kernel version, and mixes them to create a unique number label 🏷️, representing that specific version of the kernel. It’s like having a unique recipe name for each variation of a dish 🍲 you cook. This way, you can easily check 🕵️‍♂️ if the recipe (kernel version) you have is the one you need for your guests (modules). So, if you know your dish's name (kernel version), you can quickly tell if it’s the right one by checking the label (comparing `KERNEL_VERSION` and `LINUX_VERSION_CODE`).
